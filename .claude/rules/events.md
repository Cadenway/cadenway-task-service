# Events

- Event names: `<entity>.<past-tense-fact>.v<version>`; the payload is the AsyncAPI schema of the
  installed `@cadenway/contracts`.
- Publish only through the outbox of `@cadenway/nest-messaging`, in the use case transaction. Never a
  direct NATS client.
- Handlers deduplicate on the event id and call a use case; they never write another service's data.
- A shape change is a new version; the old one keeps being emitted until every consumer moved.
- Events emitted by this service: `space.*`, `list.*`, `task.created`, `task.updated`, `task.status-changed`, `task.assigned`, `task.trashed`, `task.restored`, `task.purged`, `comment.created`, `approval.requested`, `approval.decided`, `milestone.reached`.
