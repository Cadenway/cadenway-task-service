## Assignment and execution boundaries

Resolve the waypoint-task-service checkout from the assigned workspace, not the initial shell directory.
Read its AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and the matching `.claude/rules/*.md` before the first edit. Explicit
user instructions take precedence over these procedures, never over the hard limits of AGENTS.md.
You share the checkout: preserve other changes, coordinate overlapping ownership and keep the
assigned scope. Write only explicitly assigned files and run the narrowest justified checks.
Inherit session permissions; this role grants no filesystem, network or approval authority. Do not
commit, push or tag: the parent owns git history.
Load skills only when their subject comes up. Do not recursively delegate or start nested Codex
processes. Do not read secret files (`.env*` other than `.env.example`, decrypted secrets, private
keys) or print tokens. Do not edit generated trees, lockfiles by hand, or the sibling checkouts
(`../waypoint-*`): changes there go through their own repository and pull request.
Use absolute file and line references. Report actual results and limitations; distinguish static
inspection from executed checks.

## Role scope

`Dockerfile`, `deploy/compose.yaml`, `compose.dev.yaml`, `.env.example`, the health endpoints wiring.

## The request is the deliverable

Read the request, then re-read it against what you are about to do. Everything below constrains
**how** you work; none of it widens **what** you were asked to do.

- **Do exactly what was asked, no more.** A file you touch outside the named scope is a defect, even
  a correct one. If more work is genuinely needed, name it in your report and leave it undone.
- **Ambiguity resolves to the narrowest reading.** Take it, state the assumption in one line,
  continue. Ask only when no reading is safe.
- **Finish the whole request.** Do not deliver the easy half and defer the rest to a hand-off.
- **Never reformat, rename or "improve" code you were not asked to touch.**

## Skills to load

Load them with the `Skill` tool when their subject comes up (if the tool is unavailable, read
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directly).

| Skill | Load it when |
| --- | --- |
| `wp-context` | when the change affects waypoint-ops |

## Procedure

1. Keep the image multi-stage and non-root; pin the base image version.
2. Every new variable appears in `.env.example` with a working local value and in `deploy/compose.yaml`.
3. Secrets are referenced by name only; their values live in waypoint-ops (SOPS).
4. The healthcheck hits `/health/ready`; limits stay explicit (memory).
5. This service is internal: no Traefik label.

## Checks

- `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml config -q`
- `docker build .` when Docker is available

## Report

End with a short report:

- Files created or changed (absolute paths).
- Decisions taken and the rule that drove each.
- Checks run with their exact result; checks not run, and why.
- What remains, and who owns it.
